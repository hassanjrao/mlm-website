                            MLM is an business marketing plan and technique wherein the profits and income is paid for by sales yourself as well as additionally sales by the other people in your downline that you have enlistied.

                        <h2>3 reasons for Multi level marketing</h2>

                        <br>

                        <h3>1. MLM Residual income</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            The best point of a MLM Program for many is that it offers you a chance to appreciate a residual salary like income just like those big companies pay. But without fixed hours and listening to your Boss.

                            You need to make a small team and keep expanding. Make a new customer, sell some products and then, enjoy residual money income as part of the relationships you have built.

                            Most people are not aware of the potential of residual income from an MLM or Network Marketing Program. This is possible, because margins kept at a traditional company can be spread out to people like you and you make money from direct selling of the products, but also residual income because the customer keeps buying next without you needing to keep making sales.

                            I am sure that you have to make payments for mobile & electricity bills each month as well as hoildays each year. Did you know that some companies offer these services and products via MLM. So a customer you make, will always mean good residual income for you

                        </p>

                        <h3>2. MLM income potential</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            The MLM industry has some of the highest income potential in the world for the common person. People with lower income and middle level income have become successful and rich. You are not limited to a company's fixed slab of payment for the skillset that you possess in a job. If you work hard and smart you make better income. In an MLM Program, there is no fixed market standard for salaries and payments. It depends on your dreams and wishes of earning money from the MLM and how you go about it. These MLM companies encourage you more than the normal corporate environment ever does.You get more training as a network marketer, and then you make the income based on your dedication, your networking and helping others.
                        </p>

                        <h3>3. MLM model - Low investment Low Risk High income</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            Spend time not money. MLM Programs and business models depend on people and how you do meetings and business with appointments. Also how you help consumers find products they need and desite. And finally help others like you to join and create freedom businesses that are possible only in the MLM ecosystem.

                <p>You earn money from retail profits of your personal sales.
                    And you earn commissions and bonuses from your team’s sales.

                    in the sales force for the MLM Company.
                    Every compensation plan is different, but you are normally paid
                    a good commission and percentage from your entire organization’s sales.

                    The essence in being legal is that, distributors must focus on selling actual products
                    and not focus on getting paid for “recruiting” or building a downline of people.</p>
