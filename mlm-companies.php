                            <h3>Is MLM Marketing a Pyramid scheme?</h3>
                            <p class="mt-4">MLM marketing is legitimate, if somewhat controversial, business strategy. One problem is pyramid schemes that use money from recruits to pay people at the top rather than those who do the job. Such schemes include making the most of people by pretending to be engaged in legal multilevel or network marketing.</p>
                            <p>You will spot pyramid schemes by concentrating more on recruiting than on product sales. No products are involved in this scheme, get more people to dump money to make more money. However, in MLM, product sales can generate real revenue, creating a sustainable ecosystem for both themselves and their down-lines.</p>
